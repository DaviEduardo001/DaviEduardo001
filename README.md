### Hello! I'm Davi Eduardo! You can call me Eduardo!

##
- Studing mainframe development
- Android Dev 
- Reader of all the things u' can imagine
- Linux user :D

=> Studying technology in order to help more and more people is my objective. I started two years ago in the world of programming, with courses and projects for colleagues made with multiple tools (I don't think that a technology defines the person who uses it, but how the person uses it should define what the tool should do).
